Examples from *A Survivor's Guide to Java Program Analysis in Soot* (*Survivor's Guide*) extracted from the Soot source tree in September 2015, with additional examples from the thesis *Soot: A Java Bytecode Optimization Framework* by Raja Vallee-Rai that are not already included in the Survivor's Guilde.

The original Survivor's Guide website is http://www.brics.dk/SootGuide/ and Vallee-Rai's thesis can be found at http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/publications/thesis/#korMastersThesis
To satisfy the dependecies, you will of course need `soot-trunk.jar` from https://github.com/Sable/soot and `paddle-0.3.jar` from http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/paddle/
