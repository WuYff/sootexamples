# SootExamples

This project contains the examples from "A Survivor's Guide to Java Program
Analysis in Soot", extracted from the Soot source tree in September 2015.
It also contains examples from Raja Vallee-Rai's thesis "Soot: A Java
Bytecode Optimization Framework" in com.domainexpert.soot.thesis package
under src directory. The package does not contain all the examples from
the thesis as the Survivor Guides's examples already include some of the
examples from the thesis, such as the live variable analysis.

The directory doc contains the PDF versions of both the survivor's guide
and Vallee-Rai's thesis.
